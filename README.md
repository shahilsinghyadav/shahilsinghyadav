## Setup Instructions

Since `npx` was unavailable during creation, the project files were generated manually. You need to install the dependencies before running the project.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in this directory and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Structure
- `src/components/SectionCard.jsx`: Handles the "folder opening" scroll animation using `position: sticky`.
- `src/App.jsx`: Main layout.
- `src/index.css`: Global styles.
